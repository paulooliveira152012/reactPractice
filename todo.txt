### GOAL

I will create a React web application that will load 3 portions of the website by using components

WHEN I NPM start, the website opens on a landing page containing [1] a header, [2] a main section and a [3] footer
the header contains a NAV bar with [1] a List, [2] an about page and [3] a links page.

WHEN I click either options within the NAV (which is within the header) the page replaces the main content of the 
landing pagecwith the choosen section


### STEPS
1 - initialize git
2 - npm install
